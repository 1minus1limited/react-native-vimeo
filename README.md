# React Native Vimeo Player

It is easy enough to embed Vimeo videos in your React Native app using a standard
React Native Webview, however it is impossible to access the Vimeo player API that way.
This component allows you to easily embed a Vimeo video in your app and have full access to
the Vimeo player JS API (documented here https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api).

## Installation

1. Go through the instructions for installing the
`React Native Webview Bridge` component, found here: https://github.com/alinz/react-native-webview-bridge.

2. Run `npm install react-native-vimeo` within your project.

3. Compile and build to make sure everything is set up properly.
